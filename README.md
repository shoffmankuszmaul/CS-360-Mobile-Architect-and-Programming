Q. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This app should allow users to keep track of their inventory. It will have a login screen that requires a password. It should also contain a screen to display the user's inventory. 

Q. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I created four screens for this app. A login users screen, to log in to their account. The main screen of the app to display the user's inventory and a button to add new items to the list. I used specific dialogs to prompt the user to enter new item information or to update existing items. 

Q. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approached developing this application by first defining the main classes and objects needed to fulfill the app's functionalities. To do this, I identified the best data structures to use. When developing the it was important to ensure that the login screen was functional.  I did have a problem getting all the pieces to interact with each other.

Q. How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
While there were several pieces that were functional on their own, I couldn’t get them to work together to create a functional application

Q. Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Getting the login in screen to work to work properly was a big challenge.  And something I haven’t been able to over come is getting all the individual pieces to work together.

Q. In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
In this class, I show how to retrieve arguments from a bundle and to create a dialog with positive and negative buttons. I came up with a really good design.
